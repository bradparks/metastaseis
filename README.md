# meta - staseis
(for lack of a better name)

## about
meta-staesis is an in-browser audio wave editor. It aims to be usable for basic editing,
taking many queues from [audacity](). One of the goals is to create an environment that
is very easy to use and get editting quickly. Another would be to take advantage of
tools we already have available on the open web. Syncing data, publishing to other
audio hosting services(ex: soundcloud) and availablity.

The interesting technologies used in this project include the [Web Audio API]()
and [Web workers]().
